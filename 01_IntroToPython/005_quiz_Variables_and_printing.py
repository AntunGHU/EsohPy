# * Question 1: Which of these is the correct way to define (assign a value to) a variable in Python?
# 1) x:25
# 2) x = 25
# 3) x(25)
# 4) print(25)
# * Correct Answer: 2) x = 25

# * Question 2: What would the output be if you run the code below?
# ? x = 25
# ? print(x)
# ? x = 30
# ? print(x)
# 1) 25 30
# 2) 25 25
# 3) This would give you an error because x already has a value when we do x = 30.
# * Correct Answer: 1) 25 30

# * Question 3: Which of these is not a valid Python variable name?
# 1) myVariable
# 2) my_variable
# 3) _var
# 4) 1st_variable
# * Correct Answer: 4) 1st_variable

# * Question 4: Why would you write a variable name in all uppercase (all capital letters) in Python?
# 1) There's no reason to ever do this in Python. It's the wrong style.
# 2) To signal that you don't intend for this variable's value to change.
# 3) When defining important values that will be used throughout the entire code.
# * Correct Answer: 2) To signal that you don't intend for this variable's value to change.
