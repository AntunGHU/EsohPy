# Question 1
# Which of these is the correct way to define (assign a value to) a variable in Python?
#
# 1
#
# x:25
#
# 2
#
# x = 25
#
# 3
#
# x(25)
#
# 4
#
# print(25)
#
# Correct Answer
# 2
# x = 25
#
# Question 2
# What would the output be if you run the code below?
#
# x = 25
# print(x)
# x = 30
# print(x)
# 1
#
# 25
#
# 30
#
# 2
#
# 25
#
# 25
#
# 3
#
# This would give you an error because x already has a value when we do x = 30.
#
# Correct Answer
# 1
# 25
#
# 30
#
# Question 3
# Which of these is not a valid Python variable name?
#
# 1
#
# myVariable
#
# 2
#
# my_variable
#
# 3
#
# _var
#
# 4
#
# 1st_variable
#
# Correct Answer
# 4
# 1st_variable
#
# Question 4
# Why would you write a variable name in all uppercase (all capital letters) in Python?
#
# 1
#
# There's no reason to ever do this in Python. It's the wrong style.
#
# 2
#
# To signal that you don't intend for this variable's value to change.
#
# 3
#
# When defining important values that will be used throughout the entire code.
#
# Correct Answer
# 2
# To signal that you don't intend for this variable's value to change.
