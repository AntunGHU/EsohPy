# The journey begins
# Welcome to your first day of 30 Days of Python! I'm excited to guide you through this course! Whether you're new to Python or you want to review the fundamentals, I'm sure you'll enjoy this series.

# In this post you'll set up your environment so that you're ready for the first day of Python content.

# The first thing is to set up a development environment. You need a place to actually write code, and also a way to run your code. Often, development environments also give you tools to find and fix problems in your code.

# In this series we’ll be working in an online editor called repl.it, which comes with everything you need to get started. You don’t even need to make an account, # although I’d recommend you make one anyway.

# If you already have a preferred development environment, such as PyCharm or VS Code, you’re more than welcome to use that instead!

# For everyone else, here are a few things you need to know about using repl.it.
