# Contacting each other
# Welcome! Discord is your place to talk and hang out. We’re happy you’re here.
# These terms set forth our legal obligations to each other. They apply to your use of our services.
# When we say “Discord,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these terms, we mean Discord Inc., its subsidiaries, and its related companies.
# When we say “services” in these terms, we mean Discord’s services, apps, websites, and other products.
# When we say “you” or “your,” we mean you. If you’re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity (like your employer), you agree # that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and “you” and “your” will refer to that entity.
# We also have a Privacy Policy, Community Guidelines, and other policies that apply to your use of our services and are incorporated into # these terms. You should read these policies—we’ve worked hard to make them simple and clear, and they contain important information about # your use of our services. If you use our API, Discord’s Developer Terms of Service and Developer Policy apply to that use. Discord’s Paid # Services Terms apply to any purchase you make through Discord.
# Together, these rules make Discord possible, and they matter to us. If you believe others aren’t following them, please let us know: # https://dis.gd/report.
# IMPORTANT NOTE: The section titled “Settling Disputes Between You and Discord” contains an arbitration clause and class-action waiver # that applies to all U.S.-based Discord users. Please read this section carefully as it may significantly affect your legal rights, # including your right to file a lawsuit in court.
# Who we are
# We provide services that allow you to interact with other Discord users and participate in public and private communities (or “servers”). # Our services may also include access to certain software, features, and content that you can purchase from us or others.
# Discord’s services are provided by Discord Inc. We’re located at 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.
# If you reside in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, Discord Netherlands BV is the controller of your personal information # as described in our Privacy Policy. Discord Netherlands BV is located at Schiphol Boulevard 195, (1118 BG) Schiphol, the Netherlands, # registered with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce with registration number 82229864.
